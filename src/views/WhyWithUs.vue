        <h4>PRACTICAL</h4>
        <p>
          The simulations are the results of R&D in which various corporate
          finance, leveraged finance and risk professionals contributed. From
          finance foundations to complex corporate valuations, the realistic
          practical application is in every stage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box2">
        <h4>ENGAGING</h4>
        <p>
          The simulations involve competition between teams and risk-taking
          elements to excite people. The energy throughout the process is
          intense given the competitive elements while analysing, discussing,
          pitching and negotiating financial instruments and companies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <h4>INNOVATIVE</h4>
        <p>
          We offer a highly innovative training concept immersing participants
          in various investment banking tasks and leveraging stochastic
          modelling techniques to gamify the learning at the right pace.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box4">
        <h4>PARTICIPANTS ARE LOVING IT</h4>
        <p>
          Teams run their simulated investment bank and watch their own P&L rise
          and fall. They compete against each other in their own market, not
          against a computer. The gamification of learning technical corporate
          finance skills leads to very high participant satisfaction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box5">
        <h4>ONGOING SUPPORT</h4>
        <p>
          We support clients beyond a particular training event. Our products
          are tailored towards clientsâ€™ needs and follow up consultations as
          well as testing options are available.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box6">
        <h4>VALUE FOR MONEY</h4>
        <p>
          Our products are cost-effective because participants learn practical
          skills in a short time-frame, and they can directly apply what they
          have learned. Participants returning to their desk have a better
          understanding of their tasks and have gained a big picture
          understanding of different departments.
